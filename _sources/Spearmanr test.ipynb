    "# Spearson's r test\n",
    "\n",
    "[Spearson's r test](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.spearmanr.html) or Spearman's rank correlation test is one of the ways of measuring a linear correlation. It is performed on 2 independent variables and uses the assigned rank of each value in the data provided rather than the actual value. The rank of each entry is determined based on how it compares to all of the other entries. It is the non-parametric version of Pearson's r test. The Spearman correlation coefficient or \"r\" is a number between â€“1 and 1 that measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables.  The equation used to calculate the Spearman correlation is the same as that of the Pearson correlation test and is shown below.\n",
